## Introduction

This package furnishes a single Stripes plugin of type `find-eresource`,

| `onEresourceSelected` | func: (eresource) => {} | Callback fired when a user clicks an eresource | Yes | |
| `dataKey` | string | Optional `dataKey` passed to stripes/connect when creating the connected Eresources component. | | |
| `renderTrigger` | func: ({ triggerId, onClick, buttonRef }) => {} | Optional render function for the button to open the Eresource search modal. The `onClick` prop should be called when the trigger is clicked (assuming it is a Button).
